# Drivers

This directory contains reusable driver modules for peripherals and sensors. Each driver should be self-contained and follow a consistent API. For each driver, include a README describing its usage, hardware requirements, and integration steps.

Examples of drivers might include:
- GPIO expanders
- I2C/SPI sensors
- Communication modules (e.g. UART, CAN)
