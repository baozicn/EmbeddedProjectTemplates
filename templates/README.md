# Templates

This directory contains starter project templates for common embedded project scenarios. Each template provides a structured starting point, with recommended directory layout and example code to help you get started quickly.

Current templates include:

- blinky: A minimal bare-metal LED blink example for STM32 microcontrollers using the HAL library. Demonstrates basic project structure and pin initialization.

To add your own templates, create a new subdirectory here and include at minimum a README with build instructions and the necessary source files.
